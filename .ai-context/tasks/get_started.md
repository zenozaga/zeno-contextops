# Get Started: Project Onboarding & .ai-context Customization

**Description:**
This task will help you (the client) onboard your project by asking a series of questions to understand your needs, goals, and project structure. Based on your answers, the agent will analyze your project and propose a customized `.ai-context` structure tailored for you.

## How it works
1. The agent will summarize what it understands about your project from the current files and structure.
2. The agent will present this summary to you and explain the next steps.
3. The agent will ask you a set of questions, such as:
   - What is the main purpose of your project?
   - What programming languages and frameworks do you use?
   - What are your main workflows or business processes?
   - Do you have coding standards or rules to enforce?
   - What APIs, templates, or documentation are important?
   - What tasks or automations would you like the agent to perform?
   - Any special folders or files you want to include in `.ai-context` (e.g., analysis, scripts, datasets)?
4. The agent will use your answers to:
   - Propose a `.ai-context` folder structure adapted to your project.
   - Suggest initial content for rules, knowledge, templates, and tasks.
   - Guide you through the next steps to fully integrate `.ai-context`.

## Expected Output
- A summary of the current project understanding.
- A list of questions for the client.
- A proposed `.ai-context` structure and next steps for customization.
