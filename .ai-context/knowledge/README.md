# Knowledge

Purpose: Provide domain knowledge about **template creation and .ai-context best practices**.

## Template Design Patterns

- **Single Purpose**: Each template should solve one specific problem or use case
- **Modular Structure**: Templates should be self-contained but allow customization
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basics, allow advanced features through configuration

## .ai-context Best Practices

- **Rules**: Should be specific and actionable, not generic advice
- **Tasks**: Should be step-by-step and executable by agents
- **Knowledge**: Should provide context and background, not just instructions
- **Templates**: Should be production-ready with placeholders for customization
- **Goals**: Should have clear success criteria and measurable outcomes

## Template Categories

- **Project Lifecycle**: new-project, migrate-project, modernize-legacy
- **Domain Specific**: api-development, data-analysis, frontend-development
- **Operational**: ci-cd-setup, monitoring-setup, security-audit

## Validation Criteria

- Templates must be tested in real scenarios
- All referenced files must exist and be accessible
- Instructions must be clear enough for non-experts to follow
- Tasks should complete successfully without manual intervention
