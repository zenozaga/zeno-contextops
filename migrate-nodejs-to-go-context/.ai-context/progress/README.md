# Progress Tracking Guidelines

This folder is automatically created during migration to track progress and document outcomes.

## 📋 How Progress Tracking Works

When you apply this migration template, the agent will automatically:
1. **Create progress files** documenting each phase completion
2. **Update component status** as migration proceeds  
3. **Record validation results** for each migrated component
4. **Track performance improvements** throughout the process

## 📁 Expected Progress Files

During migration, these files will be created here:

- `01-codebase-analysis.md` - Results of initial code analysis
- `02-requirements-gathering.md` - Architecture decisions and user requirements  
- `03-migration-plan.md` - Detailed migration strategy and timeline
- `04-component-status.md` - Real-time component migration tracking
- `05-test-results.md` - Test execution and validation outcomes
- `06-performance-benchmarks.md` - Performance comparison data
- `migration-summary.md` - Final migration report and lessons learned

## 🎯 Purpose

This progress tracking system:
- **Maintains migration history** for future reference
- **Enables rollback** if issues occur during migration
- **Provides transparency** to stakeholders on migration status  
- **Documents decisions** and their rationale
- **Helps future agents** understand what was done and why

## 📊 How to Use

- **Agents**: Automatically update these files after each completed task
- **Users**: Review progress files to understand current status and provide feedback
- **Teams**: Use for migration reporting and knowledge sharing
