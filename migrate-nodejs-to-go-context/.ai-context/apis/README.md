# API Specifications and Standards

This folder contains API-related specifications and standards for the migrated Go application.

## 🔗 Purpose

Since Node.js to Go migration requirements vary by project, this folder provides a flexible framework for:
- **API Contract Preservation** - Ensuring migrated APIs maintain compatibility
- **Go-Specific Standards** - Implementing Go best practices for API development
- **Documentation Standards** - API documentation and specification guidelines

## 📋 Project-Specific Approach

The contents of this folder should be adapted based on your project analysis:

### For REST APIs
- OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Request/response models
- Authentication and authorization schemas
- Error response formats

### For GraphQL APIs  
- GraphQL schema definitions
- Resolver patterns in Go
- Type mappings from Node.js to Go

### For gRPC Services
- Protocol buffer definitions
- Service interface specifications
- Go gRPC implementation patterns

## 🎯 Migration Considerations

### API Compatibility
- **Preserve external contracts** - APIs used by external clients must remain unchanged
- **Internal API evolution** - Internal APIs can be improved during migration
- **Version management** - Plan for API versioning if breaking changes needed

### Go-Specific Improvements
- **Type safety** - Leverage Go's strong typing for better API contracts
- **Performance optimization** - Use Go's efficiency for better API response times
- **Error handling** - Implement Go's explicit error handling in APIs

## 📁 Typical Contents

When migrating your project, this folder might contain:

```
apis/
├── openapi/
│   ├── user-service.yaml     # User management API spec
│   └── product-service.yaml  # Product management API spec
├── schemas/
│   ├── request-models.go     # Go structs for API requests
│   └── response-models.go    # Go structs for API responses
├── middleware/
│   └── api-standards.go      # Common API middleware patterns
└── examples/
    ├── curl-examples.md      # API usage examples
    └── client-examples.go    # Go client implementation examples
```

## ✅ Best Practices

### API Design in Go
- Use structured JSON responses
- Implement consistent error formats
- Leverage Go's type system for validation
- Follow REST or GraphQL conventions appropriately

### Documentation
- Keep API documentation updated during migration
- Provide examples in both Node.js and Go formats during transition
- Document any breaking changes and migration paths

### Testing
- Maintain API contract tests
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints  
- Validate performance improvements in API responses

## 🔄 Adaptive Framework

This folder structure adapts to your specific project needs:
- **Add specifications** relevant to your APIs
- **Include standards** appropriate for your architecture
- **Document contracts** that must be preserved during migration
- **Define improvements** possible with Go implementation
