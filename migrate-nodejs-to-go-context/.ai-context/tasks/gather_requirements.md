# Gather User Requirements and Architecture Preferences

**Description:**
Collect essential user input about target Go architecture, performance requirements, constraints, and additional customization needs. This information guides all migration decisions.

## Objectives
- Understand user's target architecture vision
- Gather performance and operational requirements
- Identify constraints and non-negotiable requirements
- Document additional features or changes desired

## Prerequisites
- Codebase analysis completed
- User available for consultation
- Basic understanding of Go architecture options

## Requirements Gathering Process

### 1. Architecture Preferences Discussion

**Questions to Ask User:**

**Target Architecture Pattern:**
- "What Go architecture pattern do you prefer: microservices, monolithic, serverless, or hybrid?"
- "Are there specific Go frameworks you want to use (Gin, Echo, Chi, standard net/http)?"
- "Do you have preferences for project structure organization?"

**Deployment Target:**
- "Where will this application be deployed? (containers, cloud functions, bare metal, Kubernetes)"
- "What's your current infrastructure setup?"
- "Are there deployment constraints we should consider?"

**Performance Requirements:**
- "What performance improvements are you targeting? (latency, throughput, memory usage)"
- "What are your current performance bottlenecks in the Node.js version?"
- "Do you have specific performance benchmarks or SLAs to meet?"

### 2. Technical Constraints Identification

**Database and Data Layer:**
- "Can we modify database schemas or must they remain unchanged?"
- "What's your preferred approach for data access in Go? (ORMs, query builders, raw SQL)"
- "Are there data migration requirements?"

**External Integrations:**
- "Which external services must remain unchanged?"
- "Are there authentication/authorization systems we must integrate with?"
- "Any compliance or security requirements we must maintain?"

### 3. Additional Requirements and Changes

**Feature Modifications:**
- "Are there features you'd like to simplify or remove during migration?"
- "Any new features you'd like to add while we're migrating?"
- "Are there Node.js-specific workarounds we can improve in Go?"

**Operational Requirements:**
- "What monitoring and logging systems do you use?"
- "How do you handle configuration management?"
- "What's your testing strategy and coverage requirements?"

### 4. Timeline and Priorities

**Business Context:**
- "Which components are most business-critical and should be prioritized?"
- "What's your timeline and any hard deadlines?"
- "How do you want to handle the transition? (gradual rollout, big-bang, parallel running)"

## Requirements Documentation

### 1. Architecture Decision Record
```markdown
# Architecture Decisions for Migration

## Target Architecture: [User Choice]
- **Pattern**: Microservices/Monolithic/Serverless/Hybrid
- **Framework**: Gin/Echo/Chi/Standard Library
- **Deployment**: Containers/Cloud Functions/Kubernetes/Bare Metal
- **Rationale**: [User's reasoning]

## Performance Targets
- **Latency**: [Target response times]
- **Throughput**: [Requests per second targets]
- **Memory**: [Memory usage goals]
- **Scalability**: [Scaling requirements]
```

### 2. Constraints and Requirements
```markdown
# Project Constraints

## Technical Constraints
- **Database**: Can/Cannot modify schema
- **External APIs**: [List of systems that cannot change]
- **Authentication**: [Current system that must be maintained]
- **Compliance**: [Security/regulatory requirements]

## Operational Constraints  
- **Infrastructure**: [Current setup limitations]
- **Deployment**: [CI/CD pipeline requirements]
- **Monitoring**: [Observability requirements]
```

### 3. Feature Modification Plan
```markdown
# Feature Changes During Migration

## Features to Simplify
- [List with rationale]

## Features to Remove
- [List with rationale]

## Features to Add
- [List with rationale and priority]

## Improvements Over Node.js Version
- [Specific enhancements possible in Go]
```

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Clear architecture direction** for Go implementation
2. **Documented performance targets** and success criteria
3. **Identified constraints** that limit implementation options
4. **Feature modification plan** for migration scope
5. **User buy-in** on migration approach and timeline

## Progress Tracking

Create `/.ai-context/progress/02-requirements-gathering.md` with:
- Architecture decisions and rationale
- Performance targets and constraints
- Feature modification plan
- User approval confirmation
- Next steps based on requirements

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Target architecture pattern confirmed with user
- [ ] Performance requirements clearly defined
- [ ] All technical constraints identified and documented
- [ ] Feature modification plan agreed upon
- [ ] Timeline and priorities established
- [ ] User sign-off on migration approach
- [ ] Requirements documented for future reference
- [ ] Architecture alignment with codebase analysis confirmed

## User Validation Checkpoint

Before proceeding to migration planning:
- **Review all documented requirements with user**
- **Confirm understanding of constraints and preferences**  
- **Get explicit approval to proceed with planned approach**
- **Establish communication protocol for ongoing decisions**
