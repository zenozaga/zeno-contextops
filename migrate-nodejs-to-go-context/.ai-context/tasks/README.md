# Migration Tasks

This folder contains the sequential workflow for migrating Node.js applications to Go.

## ðŸ”„ Task Execution Order

Execute tasks in sequence. Each task builds upon the previous ones and must complete successfully before proceeding.

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning
1. `analyze_codebase.md` - Deep analysis of Node.js project structure and dependencies
2. `gather_requirements.md` - Collect user architecture preferences and constraints  
3. `create_migration_plan.md` - Generate step-by-step migration strategy

### Phase 2: Setup and Preparation
4. `setup_go_project.md` - Initialize Go project structure and tooling
5. `setup_progress_tracking.md` - Create progress tracking system

### Phase 3: Component Migration (Minimal Coupling First)
6. `migrate_types_and_constants.md` - Migrate standalone types, constants, and utilities
7. `migrate_data_models.md` - Migrate data structures and basic business objects
8. `migrate_service_layer.md` - Migrate business logic and service components
9. `migrate_api_handlers.md` - Migrate HTTP handlers and API endpoints
10. `migrate_main_application.md` - Migrate application orchestration and entry points

### Phase 4: Validation and Deployment
11. `validate_functionality.md` - Test functional parity with original Node.js version
12. `benchmark_performance.md` - Measure and validate performance improvements
13. `setup_deployment.md` - Configure deployment infrastructure and CI/CD

## ðŸ“‹ Task Instructions

- **Sequential execution required** - Complete each task fully before starting the next
- **Create tests after each task** - Every migrated component must have corresponding tests
- **Document progress** - Update `.ai-context/progress/` folder after each task completion
- **Validate with user** - Get user confirmation on architectural decisions and component migration
- **Handle errors gracefully** - If a task fails, document the issue and create recovery plan

## âœ… Task Completion Criteria

Each task is considered complete when:
1. **Objective achieved** - Task goal fully accomplished
2. **Tests created** - Automated tests validate migrated functionality  
3. **Documentation updated** - Progress logged in appropriate `.ai-context/progress/` file
4. **User validation** - User confirms component works as expected (when applicable)
5. **Performance validated** - Component meets or exceeds performance expectations
